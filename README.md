Jupyter notebook test data. Feel free to add more!

This is a collection of notebooks for testing with that you can `npm install` and rely on for testing.

```
npm install notebook-test-data
```

## Roadmap

### Easy mode

* [x] Dump a collection of notebooks, upload
* [x] Export a simple object that helps in finding notebooks by valid and invalid

### Needs Love

Create collections of notebooks that

* [ ] have different display output types
* [ ] have tracebacks
* [ ] are beautiful (subjective, great as a gallery)
* [ ] are organaized by notebook format (prev: v3, curr: v4, experimental: proposed changes)
